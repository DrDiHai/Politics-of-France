The mod replaces the political part of the French focus tree with a new one, intended to showcase the events in domestic French politics between 1936 and 1940. Also included are a number of events and the none-to-few Prime Ministers the country had in this time.
There is a partial replacement of the political tree from vanilla and supporting events. Instead of the rather generic vanilla focuses, these aim to represent real problems the French government faced: demands for more worker rights, whether to intervene in Spain etc. Of course, I aim to expand this in the future.
There is localisation in German and English. There should be in French for a mod like this, but my skills aren't up to the task. If you'd like to contribute a translation, that would be great.
My main source has been Shirer's Collaps of the Third Republic. Certainly outdated, I look forward to corrections, suggestions and improvements!
This is incompatible with any mods that change the French focus tree and events or ANY continuous focuses. It is compatible with Expert AI. Apart from that, no guarantees.
