The agreement between these powers poses a grave threat to the security of [FRA.GetNameDef], but the press of the Communist Party, loyal to Moscow, has welcomed this development. This is an opportunity to curtail the activities of political agents loyal to foreign governments and unite the people in our defense.\nTraditionally we have been able to include [Root.GetCommunistParty] in political discussions, but as they refuse to renounce their allegiance to Moscow it may be time to take drastic measures."

 france.21.d:0 "The success of the Popular Front in the elections has led to a feverish sentiment across the country. The workers and their organizations expect swift action from the government to improve their rights. To underscore these expectations, they have launched a general strike of huge proportions. Over a million men have left their factories or occupied them to prevent lockouts or strike breakers. We must act to prevent the French economy from collapsing, but the trade unions will not be easily appeased."
 france.21.a:0 "A time for decisive action"
