 french_politics.1.t:0 "The Popular Front victorious"
 french_politics.1.d:0 "Elections are finally over and all votes counted. The Popular Front, composed of a coalition of Communists, Socialists and Radicals has achieved its expected victory. With 386 of 610 seats, they hold a solid majority. Léon Blum, leader of the socialist SFIO, has been sworn in as President of the Council.\nBut a storm is already on the horizon. The Communists und Maurice Thorez have refused to participate in government and have announced simply 'tolerate' it. Whether Blum can successfuly establish a stable regime under these circumstances remains to be seen."
 french_politics.1.a:0 "A new age in France, perhaps."
 french_politics.2.t:0 "Pierre Laval resigns"
 french_politics.2.d:0 "The reputation of Prime Minister Laval has been greatly diminished by the Hoare-Laval Pact, which gave Italy a free hand in Ethiopia. In the upcoming elections, a victory by the leftist coalition, the Popular Front, seems inevitable. The President of the Council has announced that he is unable to lead the government under these circumstances and has resigned.\nIn his place, the Chamber of Deputies has elected Albert Sarraut, a member of the Radical Party. He will lead the executive branch until the coming elections."
 french_politics.2.a:0 "He is enough, for now."
 french_politics.3.t:0 "Léon Blum resigns"
 french_politics.3.d:0 "The question of intervention in the Spanish Civil War has divided the Popular Front government of Léon Blum from the start. The decision to render no direct assistance has led to bitter resentment within the cabinet, even as the parliament made it clear that the government would not survive such a step. A participation from the Communists is now out of the question.\nA weary Blum has announced his inability to continue under these circumstances and stepped down. His successor is Camille Chautemps. As a member of the Radical Party, he is a member of the Popular Front, but also a determined opponent of both intervention and far-reaching reforms. However, most ministers remain in their offices and basic questions of government are still unsolved."
 french_politics.3.a:0 "Maybe he has better luck."
 french_politics.4.t:0 "Fall of the Popular Front"
 french_politics.4.d:0 "The Popular Front government has fallen. Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader] has been ground down between the Communists on the left and Fascists on the right. Léon Blum has announced his readiness to form a new government, but on the condition that he be granted sweeping powers by parliament and a free hand for radical reforms. This found a slim majority in the Chamber of Deputies, but the Senate refused to follow him down this route.\nIn his stead, Édouard Daladier was elected as President of the Council. His government has no representatives from the Socialist or Communists. The left-wing coalition is broken.""
 french_politics.4.a:0 "The fate of France is in other hands now."
 french_politics.5.t:0 "The Finnish Question"
 french_politics.5.d:0 "The conservative parties of France were always of the opinion that the true enemy was Bolshevik Russia. Now they believe that the Russian bear has shown its true face with the attack on Finland. Since no immediate danger seems to loom from Germany, they demand that the French Republic must support the Finns in their fight against Communism. They have made it clear that they are ready to let the government fall over this question."
 french_politics.5.a:0 "We have no time for this."
 french_politics.5.b:0 "Let the crusade aginst Bolshevism begin!"
 french_politics.5.c:0 "The freedom-loving Finns need French help."
 french_politics.6.t:0 "Crisis in the Communist Party"
 french_politics.6.d:0 "The war against Germany has thrown the [Root.GetCommunistParty] into a deep crisis. In the first days of the war, they supported the war in accordance with the policy of the Popular Front. However, the party is loyal to the Comintern. Due to the non-agression treaty between the Soviets and Germany, they have received orders to return to their pacifist stance. This about face has largely discredited the party in the public eye. In addition, party leader Maurice Thorez has avoided being drafted into the army by fleeing to Russia. With their reputation and organization in tatters, it will be a long time before the Communists regain their former strength."
 french_politics.6.a:0 "All Frenchmen should stand together in these times."
 french_politics.7.t:0 "The 40-hour week and the arms industry"
 french_politics.7.d:0 "The limited work houers under the Matignon Accords severely hamper our efforts at rearmament. Now that France has a conservative government again, the opportunity should be taken to allow at least workers in the arms industry to work for longer hours. Otherwise, we will surely run out of ammunition very quickly!\nThe left will not appreciate our reasoning, claiming that this is no more than a pretext to abolish the shorter working hours. Even some of the remaining Radical-Socialist ministers are likely to resign."
 french_politics.7.a:0 "France must be ready for war."
 french_politics.7.b:0 "Labor peace and unity are more important."

 agitation_events.2.t:0 "Fascist Terror"
 agitation_events.2.d:0 "The supporters of a fascist reordering of our Republic are resolute enemies of the current policies of our government. Unfortunately, they are still well organized.

 agitation_events.3.t:0 "Military Coup"
 agitation_events.3.d:0 "Military circles have been discontent with the government over their inability keep law and order in the country. Until now, loyal officers have been able to keep the army on the government's side, but now an extremist circle with Marshal Philippe Pétain as its figurehead has decided to take action with the support of many mid-level officers. They have declared the government deposed and the constitution suspended, with Pétain as 'interim' leader until the 'current crisis' has been dealt with.\nThe constitutional government has resigned in a panic. Many members of parliament have defected to the military junta. While street battles rage on the streets of Paris, it took the remaining deputies multiple days to elect a new government. Its first course of action was to suspend the government as well and declare Pétain and his followers traitors. With the armed forces split in their support, a civil war begins."

 agitation_events.3.a:0 "We must defend the Republic!"
 agitation_events.4.t:0 "Collapse of the Third Republic"
 agitation_events.4.d:0 "The government of France is increasingly incapable of controlling its country. Now, a group of officers around Marshal Pétain has attempted a coup d'état, declaring the Republic dissolved and Pétain himself leader of a so-called French State. Many parliamentarians have joined this junta. The remaining deputies have elected an emergency government after days of heated debate, which immediately suspended the constitution. This move was unanimously confirmed. With the armed forces split between Pétain and the government, civil war seems inevitable."
