 french_politics.1.t:0 "The Popular Front victorious"
 french_politics.1.d:0 "Elections are finally over and all votes counted. The Popular Front, composed of a coalition of Communists, Socialists and Radicals has achieved its expected victory. With 386 of 610 seats, they hold a solid majority. Léon Blum, leader of the socialist SFIO, has been sworn in as President of the Council.\nBut a storm is already on the horizon. The Communists und Maurice Thorez have refused to participate in government and have announced simply 'tolerate' it. Whether Blum can successfuly establish a stable regime under these circumstances remains to be seen."
 french_politics.1.a:0 "A new age in France, perhaps."
 french_politics.2.t:0 "Pierre Laval resigns"
 french_politics.2.d:0 "The reputation of Prime Minister Laval has been greatly diminished by the Hoare-Laval Pact, which gave Italy a free hand in Ethiopia. In the upcoming elections, a victory by the leftist coalition, the Popular Front, seems inevitable. The President of the Council has announced that he is unable to lead the government under these circumstances and has resigned.\nIn his place, the Chamber of Deputies has elected Albert Sarraut, a member of the Radical Party. He will lead the executive branch until the coming elections."
 french_politics.2.a:0 "He is enough, for now."
 french_politics.3.t:0 "Léon Blum resigns"
 french_politics.3.d:0 "The question of intervention in the Spanish Civil War has divided the Popular Front government of Léon Blum from the start. The decision to render no direct assistance has led to bitter resentment within the cabinet, even as the parliament made it clear that the government would not survive such a step. A participation from the Communists is now out of the question.\nA weary Blum has announced his inability to continue under these circumstances and stepped down. His successor is Camille Chautemps. As a member of the Radical Party, he is a member of the Popular Front, but also a determined opponent of both intervention and far-reaching reforms. However, most ministers remain in their offices and basic questions of government are still unsolved."
 french_politics.3.a:0 "Maybe he has better luck."
 french_politics.4.t:0 "Fall of the Popular Front"
 french_politics.4.d:0 "The Popular Front government has fallen. Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader] has been ground down between the Communists on the left and Fascists on the right. Léon Blum has announced his readiness to form a new government, but on the condition that he be granted sweeping powers by parliament and a free hand for radical reforms. This found a slim majority in the Chamber of Deputies, but the Senate refused to follow him down this route.\nIn his stead, Édouard Daladier was elected as President of the Council. His government has no representatives from the Socialist or Communists. The left-wing coalition is broken.""
 french_politics.4.a:0 "The fate of France is in other hands now."
 french_politics.5.t:0 "The Finnish Question"
 french_politics.5.d:0 "The conservative parties of France were always of the opinion that the true enemy was Bolshevik Russia. Now they believe that the Russian bear has shown its true face with the attack on Finland. Since no immediate danger seems to loom from Germany, they demand that the French Republic must support the Finns in their fight against Communism. They have made it clear that they are ready to let the government fall over this question."
 french_politics.5.a:0 "We have no time for this."
 french_politics.5.b:0 "Let the crusade aginst Bolshevism begin!"
 french_politics.5.c:0 "The freedom-loving Finns need French help."
 french_politics.6.t:0 "Crisis in the Communist Party"
 french_politics.6.d:0 "The war against Germany has thrown the [Root.GetCommunistParty] into a deep crisis. In the first days of the war, they supported the war in accordance with the policy of the Popular Front. However, the party is loyal to the Comintern. Due to the non-agression treaty between the Soviets and Germany, they have received orders to return to their pacifist stance. This about face has largely discredited the party in the public eye. In addition, party leader Maurice Thorez has avoided being drafted into the army by fleeing to Russia. With their reputation and organization in tatters, it will be a long time before the Communists regain their former strength."
 french_politics.6.a:0 "All Frenchmen should stand together in these times."
 french_politics.7.t:0 "The 40-hour week and the arms industry"
 french_politics.7.d:0 "The limited work houers under the Matignon Accords severely hamper our efforts at rearmament. Now that France has a conservative government again, the opportunity should be taken to allow at least workers in the arms industry to work for longer hours. Otherwise, we will surely run out of ammunition very quickly!\nThe left will not appreciate our reasoning, claiming that this is no more than a pretext to abolish the shorter working hours. Even some of the remaining Radical-Socialist ministers are likely to resign."
 french_politics.7.a:0 "France must be ready for war."
 french_politics.7.b:0 "Labor peace and unity are more important."
 agitation_events.1.t:0 "General Strike"
 agitation_events.1.d:0 "The Communist are resolute enemies of the current policies of our government. They are still well organized and have many contacts and the party has been able to organize large-scale strikes to hamper our efforts. They have vowed to continue until their demands are fulfilled."
 agitation_events.1.a:0 "The Bolsheviks are a danger to our defensive readiness."
 agitation_events.2.t:0 "Fascist Terror"
 agitation_events.2.d:0 "The supporters of a fascist reordering of our Republic are resolute enemies of the current policies of our government. Unfortunately, they are still well organized. In the past weeks, they have organized a number of demonstrations and attacks, setting back several key projects."
 agitation_events.2.a:0 "We must stay the course."
 agitation_events.3.t:0 "Military Coup"
 agitation_events.3.d:0 "Military circles have been discontent with the government over their inability keep law and order in the country. Until now, loyal officers have been able to keep the army on the government's side, but now an extremist circle with Marshal Philippe Pétain as its figurehead has decided to take action with the support of many mid-level officers. They have declared the government deposed and the constitution suspended, with Pétain as 'interim' leader until the 'current crisis' has been dealt with.\nThe constitutional government has resigned in a panic. Many members of parliament have defected to the military junta. While street battles rage on the streets of Paris, it took the remaining deputies multiple days to elect a new government. Its first course of action was to suspend the government as well and declare Pétain and his followers traitors. With the armed forces split in their support, a civil war begins."
 agitation_events.3.b:0 "Only the Maréchal can save the fatherland now."
 agitation_events.3.a:0 "We must defend the Republic!"
 agitation_events.4.t:0 "Collapse of the Third Republic"
 agitation_events.4.d:0 "The government of France is increasingly incapable of controlling its country. Now, a group of officers around Marshal Pétain has attempted a coup d'état, declaring the Republic dissolved and Pétain himself leader of a so-called French State. Many parliamentarians have joined this junta. The remaining deputies have elected an emergency government after days of heated debate, which immediately suspended the constitution. This move was unanimously confirmed. With the armed forces split between Pétain and the government, civil war seems inevitable."
 agitation_events.4.a:0 "A black day for democracy."
 agitation_events.4.b:0 "The reactionary order collapses."
 agitation_events.4.c:0 "The end of a decadent republic."
 agitation_events.4.dd:0 "The world is a dangerous place."
 agitation_events.5.t:0 "Government Reshuffle"
 agitation_events.5.d:0 "Oppositional forces in parliament have forced one of our junior ministers to resign. The cabinet itself stands, but the power struggle and reshuffle will delay our efforts."
 agitation_events.5.a:0 "Curses!"
 france_communist.1.t:0 "Crisis in the Communist Party"
 france_communist.1.d:0 "The signing of a treaty of non-aggression between [SOV.GetNameDef] and [GER.GetNameDef] has put great strain on the leadership of the Communist Party here in the Commune. The fact that the French party was not consulted alone has disgruntled many who believe that, as leaders of the second major Communist nation, they have the right to be an equal partner of [SOV.GetNameDef]. Why the Russians needed a pact with [GER.GetNameDef] is itself questionable. Many think that, as the only other major power on the continent, such a treaty can only be directed against [FRA.GetNameDef], especially as the non-agression pact with [SOV.GetNameDef] from the time of the Third Republic remains in effect.\nUntil now, the party around Maurice Thorez has been a loyal member of the Comintern. But this development has strengthened those that advocate for a greater independence from the revolutionary leadership of Moscow. Strong enough, in fact, that they might challenge Thorez for leadership of the party. Even should he prevail, the damage to his prestige is considerable."
 france_communist.1.a:0 "Thorez is removed from leadership."
 france_communist.1.b:0 "The orthodox leadership prevails."
 france_communist.2.t:0 "[FRA.GetNameDef] asks to join the [Root.GetFactionName]"
 france_communist.2.d:0 "The rift between [SOV.GetNameDef] and [FRA.GetNameDef] has the latter on a desperate search for allies. It seems they believe their only chance is a pact with the devil - us. Of course, we ourselves are in desperate need of a partner on the continent. Maybe we should accept this alliance, at least for the time being."
 france_communist.2.a:0 "A sad necessity..."
 france_communist.2.b:0 "There can be no compromise with communism."
 france_communist.3.t:0 "Struggle for leadership in the Communist party"
 france_communist.3.d:0 "The Communist party has taken power in [FRA:GetNameDef] as a loyal member of the Moscow led Internationale. Now that it is at the helm of one of the major powers, however, many among its ranks expect to have an equal say in the future of the workers' movement or even take the lead from [SOV.GetNameDef].\nThe Soviet Union, as well as the orthodox leadership around Thorez, however have made it clear that such thinking is the vestige of Great Power thinking, bordering on counter-revolutionary. Lines have been drawn, and the Party must take a stance on whether it wishes to remain under Soviet tutelage to achieve world revolution, or turn [FRA.GetNameDef] into a second power of Communism."
 france_communist.3.a:0 "We must work together to achieve revolution!"
 france_communist.3.b:0 "France is the rightful leader of Internationalism."
 france_communist.4.t:0 "France invites us to their Internationale"
 france_communist.4.d:0 "The recent split between France and the Soviet Union has shaken up the Communist world. Now, [FRA.GetLeader] is looking for new allies. They have proposed that Spain and [FRA.GetNameDef] should form a new, international front to oppose both the bourgeoise counter-revolution and the misguided Soviet extremists.\nAn alliance with our neighbors would greatly increase our security, but this move is certain to antagonize the Soviet Union."
 france_communist.4.a:0 "We stand with [FRA.GetNameDef]!"
 france_communist.4.b:0 "Spain cannot afford to get involved in these affairs."
 france_communist.4.c:0 "[SOV.GetNameDef] is the true beacon of Communism!"
 france_communist.5.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] accepts"
 france_communist.5.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has accepted our proposal that our governments should work together in defending the international workers' movement."
 france_communist.5.a:0 "L'internationale sera le genre humaine!"
 france_communist.6.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] refuses"
 france_communist.6.d:0 "The [From.GetAdj] ambassador has informed us that his government is unable to align so closely with us while counter-revolutionary elements are still strong in his country."
 france_communist.6.a:0 "Their conviction is lacking."
 france_communist.7.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] wishes to join the Comintern"
 france_communist.7.d:0 "The Spanish ambassador has informed us confidentially that they have received a proposal from [FRA.GetNameDef] that their governments should enter close military ties. The formation of an ostensibly Communist alliance in Western Europe is an obvious danger for [Root.GetNameDef], but, fortunately, it seems the [From.GetAdj] remain loyal to the true Revolution. They have asked us to accept close ties with us instead. This would create an useful counter-weight and a base close to the wayward [FRA.GetName]."
 france_communist.7.a:0 "The true Internationale remains strong!"
 france_communist.7.b:0 "We cannot get involved."
 france_communist.8.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] accepts"
 france_communist.8.d:0 "The [From.GetAdj] ambassador has informed us that [From.GetNameDef] welcomes their brother nation. We have decided which side to take in the question of leadership in the Internationale."
 france_communist.8.a:0 "The true way will prevail."
 france_communist.9.t:0 "[SPR.GetNameDef] joins the Comintern"
 france_communist.9.d:0 "The Spanish have taken a long time to answer our proposal. Now we have word of secret negotiations in Moscow, concluding a treaty under which the Soviet and Spanish military will enter into close coordination and mutual assistance in case of war. It seems the Soviets wish to gain base on our borders. It remains to be hoped that open conflict within the workers' movement can be avoided..."
 france_communist.9.a:0 "Traitors!"
 france_communist.10.t:0 "The Soviet Union refuses our proposal"
 france_communist.10.d:0 "The Politburo in Moscow informs us that they cannot enter into such close co-ordination with us and encourage us to continue on our way towards true socialism in our own country."
 france_communist.10.a:0 "We stand alone..."
